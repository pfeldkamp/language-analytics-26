What we want to do here is to introduce:
- Tokenization
- POS-tagging

Different types of text
- Emoji-to-text
- Hashtags
- Mentions
- URLs
- Slang





POS tags as genre fingerprints
Instead of “here are POS tags”, do something like:
Take 3 short texts:
a recipe, a news article, a novel paragraph
Compute POS distributions (just proportions).
Plot them or print them.
Then ask:
Why does imperative-heavy text look like this?
Why does fiction overuse pronouns?
What disappears when we only look at POS?

Genre have different distributions at the POS level.
- and at the token level (word distributions)
- and at the character level (e.g., emoji use)
- and at the syntactic level (e.g., sentence length, complexity)
- and at the semantic level (e.g., sentiment, topics)
- and at the pragmatic level (e.g., speech acts, politeness strategies)

so we need to know what data we have                                                                                                            q
