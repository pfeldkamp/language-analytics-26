# Examination

## Format

We **assume basic coding ability**. Code can be pointed to as an appendix, but **does not count toward the assessment**
- To ensure basic coding competence, students are required to submit code for all course assignments through the course so it can be reviewed and discussed during the course

Individual exam consisting of **5 projects**, each involving inference, results, and reflection.
The **final project is self-assigned (free-form)** and is intended to ensure an **original research question** & **original research work**

## The five projects

1. **Linguistic analysis** (descriptive)
2. **Classification**  (dataset + features + parametres)
3. **N-gram model**
4. **Topic modelling**
   - instead of inference, this could be a review of a case study using topic modelling (DH paper etc)
5. **Free-form project (self-assigned)**
   - original research question
   - method chosen by the student



## Academic objectives (studieordning)

In the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to demonstrate the following:

Knowledge:
- contrast strengths and weaknesses of automated text analysis, compared to more traditional text analysis methods, across different use contexts
- discuss **different types of linguistic data** and their affordances for automated data analysis
- explain how language and text analytics bears on central research questions in the humanities, and its relation to traditional methods.

Skills:
- conduct **original** research using computationally-assisted analysis of digital language data.

Competences:
- critically reflect on the role of text analytics in the **students’ primary field**
- independently identify relevant analytical features of digital language data **for an original research question**.

**Note:**  
The requirement for an original research question and original research is explicitly addressed through the **final self-assigned project**.



## Requirements for each project

Each project must include:

- **Code** (in appendix)
- **Introduction**
  - brief context and research question
- **Short description of the method**
- **Results**
  - at least **one visualization**
  - tables are optional
- **Interpretation**
  - what can be said based on the method and results?
- **Method reflection**
  - strengths  
  - weaknesses  
  - possible alternatives
- **Limitations**
  - including issues related to responsible NLP


## We expect

- citations of **relevant literature and software packages** (no full literature review required)
- at least **one visualization per project**
- clear and readable presentation of results
  - visualizations should be informative
  - tables should be used where appropriate
- critical reflection on methods and limitations

## We do not care about

- **code quality**
- **originality** for the first four assignments (!)
- **writing style** (you can write it as a blog-post, a process report, or an academic paper, as long as it's clear and well-structured)



## Submission

- **One single PDF** containing all five projects





## Use of chatbots

Students are allowed to use chatbots.

What counts in the assessment, however, is:
- clarity of thinking  
- analytical vision  
- quality of interpretation and reflection  

Chatbots often produce fluent but **content-light** text. Submissions that rely on generic or vague descriptions without clear ideational content or arguments will be graded accordingly.
