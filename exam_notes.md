# Examination

## Format
The exam format for the course is a written portfolio consisting of 5 separate mini-projects, each involving an *introduction section, methods, results, inference, and reflection*.
4 mini-projects will be handed in throughout the course as assignments and will be based on **clearly defined project guidelines**. The final project is self-assigned (free-form) and is intended to ensure that all students are tasked with defining an **original research question** and performing **original research work**.

While we encourage collaboration when working on code for the assignments, the exam is **individual**, and all content in the portfolio must be created by the student submitting the exam.

Code can be included as an appendix (encouraged), but **does not count toward the assessment.**
To ensure basic coding competence, students are required to submit code for all course assignments throughout the course so it can be reviewed and discussed during the course

## The five projects 
1. **Linguistic analysis** (descriptive analysis)
2. **Text classificaiton**  (dataset + feature generation + model training)
3. **Generative N-gram language model**
4. **Topic modelling**
   - instead of inference, this could be a review of a case study using topic modelling (DH paper etc)
5. **Free-form project (self-assigned)**
   - original research question
   - method chosen by the student (approved by teachers)

## Academic objectives (studieordning)
In the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to demonstrate the following:

Knowledge:
- contrast strengths and weaknesses of automated text analysis, compared to more traditional text analysis methods, across different use contexts
- discuss **different types of linguistic data** and their affordances for automated data analysis
- explain how language and text analytics bears on central research questions in the humanities, and its relation to traditional methods.

Skills:
- conduct **original** research using computationally-assisted analysis of digital language data.

Competences:
- critically reflect on the role of text analytics in the **students’ primary field**
- independently identify relevant analytical features of digital language data **for an original research question**.

**Note:**  
The requirement for an original research question and original research is explicitly addressed through the **final self-assigned project**.


## Requirements for each project
Each project must include:

- **Introduction**
  - A stated research question and brief context/justification
- **Description of the methods**
- **Results**
  - at least **one visualization**
  - tables are optional
- **Discussion**
   - *Interpretation*
     - what can be said based on the method and results?
   - *Method reflection*
     - strengths and weaknesses  
     - possible alternatives/future directions
   - *Limitations*
     - including issues related to responsible NLP
- **Code (in appendix)** - encouraged

## We expect
- citations of **relevant literature and software packages** (no full literature review required)
- at least **one visualization per project**
- clear and readable presentation of results
  - visualizations should be informative
  - tables should be used where appropriate
- critical reflection on methods and limitations

## We do not care about
- **code quality** - although the code naturally must be working as intended / produce ecologically valid outputs
- **originality** for the first four mini-projects (!) - we have designed the research questions for these assignments
- **writing style** (you can write it as a blog-post, a process report, or an academic paper, as long as it's clear and well-structured)

## Submission
- **One single PDF** containing all five projects

## Use of chatbots
Students are allowed to use chatbots.

What counts in the assessment, however, is:
- clarity of thinking  
- analytical vision  
- quality of interpretation and reflection  

Chatbots often produce fluent but **content-light** text. Submissions that rely on generic or vague descriptions without clear ideational content or arguments will be graded accordingly.
